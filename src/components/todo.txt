you still gotta strgatrically add all these icons (so maybe some in the desktoplayer, others in sidebar idk wherever makes most sense): 

When you click the thumbnail have it open the song info tab specifically each time

make in tab volume work

Add a connections icon see if you can make that work, like how spotify does it

More padding for seekbar area

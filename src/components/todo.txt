you still gotta strgatrically add all these icons (so maybe some in the desktoplayer, others in sidebar idk wherever makes most sense): 

The crown, star, fan and CircleDollarSign is for audio (max, high, normal and data saver), Golden, Purple, Blue, Green respectively like below 

{quality === 'MAX' && 'HiFi Plus Quality (24-bit, up to 192kHz)'}
{quality === 'HIGH' && 'HiFi Quality (16-bit, 44.1kHz)'}
{quality === 'NORMAL' && 'High Quality (320kbps AAC)'}
{quality === 'DATA_SAVER' && 'Data Saver (128kbps AAC)'}


When you click the thumbnail have it open the song info tab specifically each time

make in tab volume work

Add a connections icon see if you can make that work, like how spotify does it

More padding for seekbar area and move it below the controls

Add a full screen button to full screen aswell like on spotify

Auto Scroll to lyrics when playing (take this from mobilePlayer.tsx)
